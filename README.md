# MusicStore
Music Store allows you to store album reviews, built using MVVM architecture and LiveData Lifecycle classes.

This sample Kotlin app shows a list of custom reviews added by the users, the app displays the content with RecyclerView and uses a traditional adapter. The architecture is MVVM and the ViewModel is in charge of preparing the UI state for the MainActivity. The activity listens for state changes through Flow observing.
